# eistoolbox

eistoolbox is a toolbox for MATLAB(R) used for batch fitting Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data to equivalent circuit models.

The goal is to calculate the optimal circuit elements using standard minimization functions, such as the complex nonlinear least-squares method.

After obtaining the best fit, the toolbox also estimates the chi-square Goodness-of-Fit. This parameter describes how well the fitted data adjusts to the original measured data.

The toolbox is currently under active development.

## Instructions

Run 'eistoolbox.m' to start the main program!

1. Add CSV or DTA data with the button 'Add files...'
2. Write your circuit in the dialog (based on Zfit format)
3. Select the fitting algorithm
4. Hit the 'Fit' button!
5. Save the results with the button 'Save as...'

### Input file formats

- CSV files must have three columns: FREQ,REAL,IMAG
- DTA files are from Gamry Instruments (tested Gamry 1000 Interface)

### Circuit string formats

At the moment, circuits can be written according to the Zfit specification:

-Elements can be connected in series as s(R1,R1) or in parallel as p(R1,R1) with as many elements as you want. Example: s(R1,R1,C1,C1,p(R1,C1,E2))

-All elements must include the number of fitting parameters. A resistance has one fitting parameter and therefore it is R1. A CPE has two parameters and therefore is written as E2.

-Careful! Do not treat elements as labels (i.e. R1, R2, R3... is incorrect.) The correct way is R1, R1 and R1.

-ToDo: Click the "load" button next to the fit string to load some predefined circuit examples.

-Read the source of the file Zfit.m for full documentation about circuit string formatting.

## External libraries used in this toolbox

fminsearchbnd by John D'Errico is found [here](http://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8277-fminsearchbnd--fminsearchcon).

Zfit is from Jean-Luc Dellis, [available here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19460-zfit).

More fitting functions will be available in the future (such as Levenberg-Marquardt, Nelder-Mead, BFGS, Powell). If you have more algorithm suggestions, let me know.

\textbf{eistoolbox} is a toolbox for MATLAB\textregistered{} used for batch fitting Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data to equivalent circuits. 

Presently it is \textbf{alpha software}, and it will evolve over time.

\section{Current capabilities}

It can accept any number of input files, both in CSV and Gamry DTA formats.

The CSV files should contain three columns with the impedance data, in the order: FREQ,REAL,IMAG. 

The imaginary part can be positive or negative; the absolute value is taken inside the program before plotting.

The fitting algorithm uses the "fminsearch" function, implemented using the Zfit library from Jean-Luc Dellis. 

It accepts any type of circuit model, built with serial and parallel elements, in the Zfit circuit string format.

The currently implemented elements are: resistors, capacitors, inductors and constant-phase elements (CPE). 

The Warburg element can be implemented by using a CPE and setting the second parameter to 1/2.





\section{Planned updates}

In the future it will accept Levenberg-Marquard, Nelder-Mead, BFGS and Powell algorithms.

It will also include the error percentages of every fitting parameter, as well as the Pearson coefficient and correlation plot of the fitting results.

\section{Quick start guide}

1. Add files using the "Add file..." button

2. Write the circuit string and fitting parameters

3. Click the "Fit" button

4. Save the results using the "Save..." button

% fminsearchbnd: fminsearch, but with bound constraints by transformation
% usage: fminsearchbnd(fun,x0,LB,UB,options,p1,p2,...)
% 
% arguments:
%  LB - lower bound vector or array, must be the same size as x0
%
%       If no lower bounds exist for one of the variables, then
%       supply -inf for that variable.
%
%       If no lower bounds at all, then LB may be left empty.
%
%  UB - upper bound vector or array, must be the same size as x0
%
%       If no upper bounds exist for one of the variables, then
%       supply +inf for that variable.
%
%       If no upper bounds at all, then UB may be left empty.
%
%  See fminsearch for all other arguments and options.
%  Note that TolX will apply to the transformed variables. All other
%  fminsearch parameters are unaffected.
%
% Notes:
%
%  Variables which are constrained by both a lower and an upper
%  bound will use a sin transformation. Those constrained by
%  only a lower or an upper bound will use a quadratic
%  transformation, and unconstrained variables will be left alone.
%
%  Variables may be fixed by setting their respective bounds equal.
%  In this case, the problem will be reduced in size for fminsearch.
%
%  The bounds are inclusive inequalities, which admit the
%  boundary values themselves, but will not permit ANY function
%  evaluations outside the bounds.
%
%
% Example usage:
% rosen = @(x) (1-x(1)).^2 + 105*(x(2)-x(1).^2).^2;
%
% fminsearch(rosen,[3 3])     % unconstrained
% ans =
%    1.0000    1.0000
%
% fminsearchbnd(rosen,[3 3],[2 2],[])     % constrained
% ans =
%    2.0000    4.0000

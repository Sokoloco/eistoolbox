%% Read Gamry EIS data files (.DTA)
% This function removes the headers and all the non-relevant information,
% and imports the impedance spectroscopy curve to MATLAB.
% The input file should be a .DTA file from Gamry Framework Software.
% This script has been fully tested using a Gamry 1000 Interface.
%
% The output is a three-column matrix with the columns: FREQ, ZREAL, ZIMAG.
% This is the same format required for the Zfit library (Jean Luc Dellis).
%
% Example: If the input file is labelled 'EXPERIMENT.DTA', call this as
% > impmatrix = GamryRead('EXPERIMENT.DTA');
% This reads the file and stores the impedance data in a workspace variable.
